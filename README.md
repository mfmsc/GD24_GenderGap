# GD24_GenderGap
Visualization of gender disparity for the graph drawing contest 2024.

# Workflow
The [Olympic Games](https://mozart.diei.unipg.it/gdcontest/assets/2024/olympics.json) dataset is combined with data from the Global Gender Gap Report 2023.

The process begins with the compilation of a list of mapped and unmapped countries from the dataset, which forms the starting point for manual processing. The data is refined to close any gaps or inconsistencies.

Subsequently, the respective gender gap scores are assigned to the successor countries to ensure that the data is correct and up-to-date. This prepares the dataset for a more detailed analysis.

Once the mapping is complete, a list of countries is created. The data is sorted in descending order to rank the information in order of gender differences.

Once sorted, the countries are divided into nine different groups. This categorization allows for a more detailed examination of trends and patterns within the data set.

Finally, stacked charts are created from this grouped data and combined with each other. These charts serve as the basis for creating a comprehensive figure that summarizes the key findings from the analysis.
